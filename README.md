# PSN-PHP Wrapper

A PHP wrapper for the PlayStation API.

# NOTICE:

The current version of this library (v2.1.3) will no longer work as Sony has disabled the login method using this version of the API. You _can_ pull in the master branch using Composer, but just know that it is not 100% working and there are a lot of breaking changes that have not been documented yet. Only update if absolutely necessary.

I will be working on this whenever I have the time to try to get it updated ASAP!
